Todo list:
 - Schema 
   - NO TABLES ARE LINKED. There are TODOs in /db-util.js that mark all of the locations foreign keys need to be added
   - No field to count model usages
   - No table to count dashboard stats
     - The Dashboard page is entierly hardcoded
   - Models' data field is limited to 255 characters, this should be extended
 - Models page
   - Import buttons in update/create model page need to be updated
   - Doesn't check that the color is a valid hex RGB color, only that it is six characters long. Could be resolved with a simple regex
 - Login page
   - Username and login aren't checked right now, hardcoded in /components/Login.vue
   - Log in with Google/Facebook buttons need to be implemented 
   - Create an account doesn't send a query to the DB, no endpoints for it yet either

Known bugs:
 - Updating models or endpoints doesn't update the updatedBy field (may have been resolved, untested)
 - Endpoints behaviors field does not exist in DB
 - Some of the dates are off, may be on UTC?

Other notes: 
 - DB dumps exist in /Backups. 
   - DB can be seeded with /Backups/jumbaliar.sql
   - jumbaliarOLD.sql is a backup of the prisma DB and likely can be deleted
 - Only profile usernames have to be unique, not emails
 - /server/api/util.* were used to set up/wipe the DB, otherwise not used. A remnant function from this is in /backend/modelsBackend.ts
 - When requests fail the server endpoints return -1
 - The GUI offers no way for the user to edit an Endpoint's locked property during creation or editing
 - Don't ask about the email validation regex
